# Things I learned along the way

I'm ussing classic.lua for the classes, but it's not as robust as I want, 
I think I should mix it with the code I wrote for the classes in Playdate and 
take the best of both worlds

love.load runs once.
love.update runs every frame, and it passes dt (delta time) as an arg for anything to use
love.draw runs at the end of every frame

love caps
